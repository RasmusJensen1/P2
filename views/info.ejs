      <h3>How to make a good budget</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Before making a budget, it is a good idea to prepare yourself by
          identifying all your fixed expenses, such as rent, fixed travel
          expenses, internet, Spotify, etc. Once you have identified all your
          fixed expenses, start creating your budget by adding them using the +
          sign. Then, assess how much money you have left. After getting an
          overview of the remaining funds, begin by adding the remaining
          necessary expenses to your budget, such as food, activities money
          (cafe, going out).
