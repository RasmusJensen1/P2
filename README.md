Expensia Budget Website

# Project Description

Our project addresses the financial challenges faced by young adults, primarily stemming from factors such as a lack of information and not utilizing financial tools such as a budget. We've developed a website featuring a user-friendly budgeting tool tailored to this demographic. The site has a simple design and intuitive interface, enabling users to create and manage budgets with interactive charts and sliders. Additionally, the website includes an informative section featuring a brief glossary of financial terms and guidance on creating a good budget. Our goal is to empower young adults to manage their finances effectively and avoid debt, sometimes leading to health issues such as stress, etc.

# Techstack:

Node.js: We are using Node.js for its ability to execute JavaScript on the server side, which streamlines backend development.
Its ability to work more asynchronously makes it possible for us to communicate with a database.

Express: As our backend framework, Express handles HTTP requests, integrates middleware, defines routes, and more. Its minimalist design allows for flexibility and scalability.

EJS (Embedded JavaScript): EJS serves as our view engine for dynamic website rendering. By embedding JavaScript code directly into HTML templates, EJS simplifies the creation of reusable components and helps reduce code duplication (and potential errors when working in a larger group). This allows us to maintain a clean and organized codebase while efficiently generating dynamic content on the server side.

Mongoose: Mongoose interacts with MongoDB, our chosen database solution. It provides a way to model application data and define schemas, making it easier to perform queries and manipulate data from the backend.

MongoDB: MongoDB is our data storage system. It handles various types of data, such as user budgets and account information, in a scalable and efficient manner.
